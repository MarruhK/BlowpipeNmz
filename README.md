# BlowpipeNmz
An OSRS botting script for TRibot that trains ranged at NMZ via a blowpipe

It is able to:
    Bank to get prayer potions, cash for coffer and darts/scales for pipe
    Detects when you have no cash in coffer and gets it from bank
    Obtains super range pots from the barrel. If none exist, purchases them from the shop.

Restrictions
    The bot only operates with Prayer potions, blowpipe(Mith darts) and super ranging potions.
    Standard NMZ restrictions: 
      Need to have cash in bank or in coffer to start dream (26k min)
      Need to have at least 1500 Mithril Darts in bank/pipe and 20% scales in bank/pipe
      Need to have at least 20 prayer potions in bank/inventory
      Need to have 6 full super ranging potions in inventory, or enough points to buy them

Initial Set-up
    Must be wearing a blowpipe (doesn't matter if charged or not).
    Blowpipe only is able to use Mithril Darts.
